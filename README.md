This tweak makes all photos shoot in HDR.
This does have some issues/drawbacks. All photos are taken in HDR, and you can't change that from the Camera app. You will have to change it from the Settings app. Also, flash is unavailable while HDR is on because flash conflicts with HDR. There is also a setting to disable the non-HDR shot that is taken alongside the HDR one.
This is my first tweak, please be gentle.
You are more than welcome to recommend me to add things, change things, or to improve my code. I just whipped this up, and anyone who can polish it is more than welcome to do so!
