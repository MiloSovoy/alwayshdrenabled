This tweak makes all photos shoot in HDR, as seen in iOS 7.1.
This does have some issues/drawbacks. All photos are taken in HDR, and you can't change that. Also, the HDR setting appears to be off even though it is on. Finally, flash is unavailable because it conflicts with HDR.
This is my first tweak, please be gentle.
You are more than welcome to recommend me to add things, change things, or to improve my code. I just whipped this up, and anyone who can polish it is more than welcome to do so!
